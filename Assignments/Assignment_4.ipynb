        "\n",
        "This notebook is hosted on Google Colab. To be able to work on it, you have to create your own copy. Go to *File* and select *Save a copy in Drive*.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also avoid using Colab entirely, and download the notebook to run it on your own machine. If you choose this, go to *File* and select *Download .ipynb*.\n",
        "\n",
        "The advantage of using Colab is that you can use a GPU. You can complete this assignment with a CPU, but it will take a bit longer. Furthermore, we encourage you to train using the GPU not only for faster training, but also to get experience with this setting. This includes moving models and tensors to the GPU and back. This experience is very valuable because for many interesting models and large datasets (like large CNNs for ImageNet, or Transformer models trained on Wikipedia), training on GPU is the only feasible way.\n",
        "\n",
        "The default Colab runtime does not have a GPU. To change this, go to *Runtime - Change runtime type*, and select *GPU* as the hardware accelerator. The GPU that you get changes according to what resources are available at the time, and its memory can go from a 5GB, to around 18GB if you are lucky. If you are curious, you can run the following in a code cell to check:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sh\n",
        "!nvidia-smi\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that despite the name, Google Colab does  not support collaborative work without issues. When two or more people edit the notebook concurrently, only one version will be saved. You can choose to do group programming with one person sharing the screen with the others, or make multiple copies of the notebook to work concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Submission:** Upload your notebook in .ipynb format to Canvas. The code and answers to the questions in the notebook are sufficient, no separate report is expected."

A is the adjacency matrix with loops which is obtained by adding the identity matrix to the original adjacency matrix. The addition of loops allows each node to consider its own features along with its neighbors’. D is the degree matrix of A, which counts the connections including its own edges for each node. The formula normalizes A with D^(-1/2) on both sides to balance the influence of each node,. This prevents nodes with many connections from dominating the feature updating process. When this normalized adjacency matrix is multiplied by the feature matrix X, it blends each node's features with those of its neighbors which allowed information to flow through the graph. The final multiplication with the weight matrix, W transforms these features. This is similar to layers in traditional neural networks. This enables GCNs to effectively capture both the graph's structural and the nodes information.\n"

        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "a) In the mentioned paper, the problem is classified as semi-supervised due to the classification of nodes within a graph where only a small subset of nodes are labelled. This scenario, combining a limited amount of labelled data with a larger volume of unlabeled data, epitomizes semi-supervised learning. The paper addresses this challenge effectively by applying graph convolutional networks to graph-structured data\n",
        "\n",
        "b) The data split proportion was as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "Training Set: 140 nodes for training. (8.5%)\n",
        "Validation Set: 500 nodes for validation. (30.5%)\n",
        "Test Set: 1000 nodes for testing. (61%)\n",
        "\n",
        "In the Cora dataset, labelled data used for training represents only a tiny fraction of the total data (one out of 140 nodes). In contrast, in the MNIST dataset, most of the data (one out of 60,000 training images) is used for training. Furthermore, the division of the Cora dataset reflects the need for semi-supervised learning, which utilizes a small amount of labelled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. At the same time, the MNIST dataset was divided primarily to adequately train the supervised learning model and evaluate it on a larger test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "c) The reasons contain the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "GCN overcomes the limitations of graph Laplacian regularization-based approaches: Traditional graph Laplacian regularization-based approaches can be limited because they assume that edges only represent similarities between nodes. GCN efficiently captures complex relationships between nodes by operating directly on the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "Optimization Simplification: Compared to Skip-gram-based methods, GCN avoids complex multi-step processing procedures that are often difficult to optimize.\n",
        "\n",
        "Efficient propagation of feature information: GCN improves classification performance by propagating feature information from neighbouring nodes in each layer, outperforming methods that only aggregate label information, such as ICA."

        "In the previous sections you learned how to pass the adjacency matrix of a graph with a couple of thousand of nodes, to classify each node with a particular label. A different and useful application of GCNs is graph classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast with the previous part, where there was a single, big graph, in graph classification we have multiple graphs, and each graph can be assigned a label. In this part of the assignment you will implement a classifier for proteins.\n",

        "[Proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)) are parts of the buildings block of life. They consist of chains of amino acids, and can take many shapes. In the PROTEINS dataset, proteins are represented as graphs, where the nodes are amino acids, and an edge between them indicates that they are 6 [Angstroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angstrom) apart. All graphs have a binary label, where 1 means that the protein is not an enzyme.\n",

        "(1) Training Loss: The loss curve indicates that the model learns and improves over time. After an initial rapid decline, the loss gradually levels off, indicating near convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "(2) Validation Accuracy: Accuracy improves with increasing epoch, showing the model's ability to learn. Despite slight fluctuations, the accuracy stays at a high level, showing good generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "(3) Test Accuracy: The accuracy of the test set reaches 72.3%, demonstrating that the model has reasonable prediction ability for unknown data, although slightly lower than the validation set performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "(4) Overfitting: Small fluctuations in the accuracy curve at some points may mean that some epochs are slightly overfitted on the validation set. But overall, the generalization performance of the model is improving.\n",
        "\n",
        "(5) Early Stopping: The implementation of early stopping can be considered as a preventive measure. Avoid continuing ineffective training when the accuracy is no longer improving, so as to save time and computational resources. A \"patience\" parameter can be set to stop training if the accuracy does not improve after a certain number of epochs; second, although the current risk of overfitting is not high, early stopping can be used as a precautionary measure to prevent performance degradation in future training.\n",
        "\n",
        "(6) Possible Strategies for Improvement:\n",
        "> (a) Regularization: If fluctuations are a sign of overfitting, try adding a Dropout layer or using L2 regularization.\n",
        "\n",
        "> (b) Activation functions and optimizers: try different activation functions (e.g. LeakyReLU) or other optimizers (e.g. AdamW).\n",
        "\n",
        "> (c) Pooling strategies: improved graph pooling methods, such as using global average pooling or attention mechanisms, may better summarize graph features.\n",

        "If you are interested in applying graph neural networks to larger graphs, or try newer architectures, you can dive deeper into [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a library with fast implementations for a wide range of architectures. It also comes with custom code that takes care of aspects that you dealt with manually for this assignment, like a more efficient implementation of the adjacency matrix multiplication via message-passing methods, and Data Loaders that relieve you from having to build block diagonal sparse matrices.\n",
